/**
 * <p>This package contains all the Selenium PageObjects
 * of the Framework.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Famous Smoke Web Testing Framework implements a
 * variation of the <a
 * href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#page-object-design-pattern">
 * Page Object Design Pattern</a>, hence we encapsulate
 * all the WebElements inside of proper Classes representing
 * different Page types.</p>
 *
 * <p>The BasePage represents the common elements that exists
 * in all the pages we are going to evaluate.</p>
 *
 * <p>For clarity of purpose all the interaction with the
 * Page Objects is through the classes static public
 * interfaces.</p>
